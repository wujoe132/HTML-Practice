History
</h1>
<body>
<p>
What can we hope to understand by studying the past? What relevance could
the lives of people in ancient Egypt, medieval China, even in such recent epochs
as Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe or colonial India have to our modern
world? Historians know that all modern culture and conflict can only be
understood by turning to its historical roots. The events, people, triumphs and
mistakes of the past are the key to understanding the forces and factions at
work today. As a history major at UC Davis, you will work with some of the
country's foremost historical researchers and writers, whose areas of expertise
span the ages and the globe. Your study will prepare you for postgraduate
study in history, law or other areas or to enter any career requiring independent
critical thought.

Your coursework in history will begin with a survey of history, including at least
two world regions (Western civilization, Asia, the U.S. and Latin America or
Africa). You will then decide whether to complete Plan I (providing a broad
education in histories of several geographic areas) or Plan II (encouraging
independent work, seminars, the study of historical thought, and active
engagement in research and writing). In either plan, you will choose one major
and one minor field of concentration from the following possibilities: pre-
industrial Europe, modern Europe, United States history, Asian history, African
history and Latin American history.
