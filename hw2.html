            <p class="main-content-first-line"><span class="main-content-first-letter">I</span> wonder if the robot uprising will be this anticlimactic.</p>
            <p>The first robot in history to ring the New York Stock Exchange closing bell didn’t swing a gavel, though it could’ve. Instead the Universal Robot’s gray, UR5 e robot arm pressed a button at precisely 4 PM ET on Wednesday for 2 seconds to signal the close of trading. Then it did a little dance.</p>
            <p>“You have to have a little theater. You have to put in a show,” said Stu Shepherd, Regional Sales Director, America’s, for Universal Robots, after the ceremony, acknowledging that perfectly executing the program of button pushing for his sophisticated yet easy-to-program industrial robot wasn’t really enough.</p>
            <p>His robot wasn’t even the point of this tiny demonstration. The UR5 e rang the NYSE bell to celebrate another milestone, 5 years since ROBO Global launched its ROBO ETF (also known as a portfolio). It’s essentially a multi-billion-dollar index of robotics, automation and AI companies. They were also celebrating ROBO Global’s new relationship with the NYSE.</p>
