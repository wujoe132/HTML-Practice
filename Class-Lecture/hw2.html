        wonder if the robot uprising will be this anticlimactic.
        The first robot in history to ring the New York Stock Exchange closing bell didn’t swing a gavel, though it could’ve. Instead the Universal Robot’s gray, UR5 e robot arm pressed a button at precisely 4 PM ET on Wednesday for 2 seconds to signal the close of trading. Then it did a little dance.
        “You have to have a little theater. You have to put in a show,” said Stu Shepherd, Regional Sales Director, America’s, for Universal Robots, after the ceremony, acknowledging that perfectly executing the program of button pushing for his sophisticated yet easy-to-program industrial robot wasn’t really enough. 
        His robot wasn’t even the point of this tiny demonstration. The UR5 e rang the NYSE bell to celebrate another milestone, 5 years since ROBO Global launched its ROBO ETF (also known as a portfolio). It’s essentially a multi-billion-dollar index of robotics, automation and AI companies. They were also celebrating ROBO Global’s new relationship with the NYSE.
        “It defined the robotics universe for investors,” said ROBO Global CEO Travis Brigg who told me the index is now licensed in 11 countries. Briggs did get to swing a gavel, by the way.    
        Celebrating a robot portfolio with a robot seemed obvious, though planning started back in May, mainly to secure permissions said Shepherd.

        Universal Robot’s parent company, Teradyne, is part of the index, as well. ROBO global helps the finance community understand his industry, Shepherd told me.
        For the ceremony, Universal Robots chose the roughly 40 lb. UR5 e, a new model robot that, like most Universal Robots devices, is a programmable arm that accepts a wide variety of end-effectors like grippers and button-pushers.
        They wrote a special program for the event and then, the day before of the ringing, brought the robot to the floor of the NYSE. They then had to get it to the cramped platform that juts out of the wall of the New York Stock Exchange.
        “It took longer to bring it up the stairs than it did to get it running,” said Shepherd who added the robot uses standard 110 AC power and that there was an outlet on the platform. Still the cramped space and number of people surprised Shepherd.

        As is typically the case with a closing bell timing ceremony, the gallery was packed with people. Everyone was so close to the robot, said Shepherd, that people were all touching it. The UR5 e is incapable of hurting anyone. If someone bumps into it, or it gently bumps someone, the robot stops and restarts.
        ROBO Global represents the potential for robotics and automation and Universal Robotics is that promise made practical, but the event made me think about Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO who ended up relying too heavily on automation in his quest to build 500,000 Model 3s.

        In light of this, I asked Shepherd if we expect too much from robotics. “Sometimes? Yes,” he said but added that Musk is an extraordinary case and situations like that can be avoided if people are educated about what robots can and can’t do. Universal Robots robots are designed, for instance, as co-work robotics or “cobots,”, those designed to work alongside humans.
        Perspective helps, too. “People see this and hope it’s the next big thing. It’s just another of many choices in automation.”
        In the end, the crowd applauded before, during and after UR5 e hit the button. It’s wasn’t fireworks, but it was a show.
